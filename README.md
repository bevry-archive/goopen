# Go Open

Increasing the awareness of Going Open and removing the FUD around them


## Story

### What is Going Open?

Going Open is a blanket term that covers:

- Free Open-Source Software
- Free Culture
- Open Collaboration
- Open Data
- Open Government
- Open Companies

In the end it means you make everything available to the world freely and publicly, and earn your money via crowd-funding.


### What are the benefits of going open?

- Infinitely and Instantly Scalable Team
	- Closed teams generally just focus on the roadmap, which doesn't cover the little things; Whereas open teams, opens you up to pull-requests that cover all sorts of small things (add reference)
- You sell your Brand, not your Products
	- Information was made to be free, and is fundamentally organic, you're not meant to own it
		- When I say "hello", I don't lose it like psyhical property, instead it is copied into your brain
		- Reference Tim Beners Lee talking about the Open Data Movement, "you wouldn't believe the amount of execuses people come up with to keep their information closed"
	- If someone "steals" your product, you are still fine
- There is no competition, only collaboration

### How do I earn money and make the transition?

Traditionally, we earned our money to do what we love by:

1. Creative a closed work (that isn't what we love)
2. Sell the closed work (that isn't what we love)
3. Use the proceeds to do what we love

With going open, instead we:

1. Do what we love
2. Inspires others to donate to us
3. Use the proceeds to do what we love

	- In the end, the decision to go open-source or not, is how difficult do you want to make the reverse engineering process? Going closed means very difficult and no attribution for you, going open means very easy and attribution to you.
